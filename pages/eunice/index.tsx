                        happy birthday big sis. you're finally 30% of the way to
                        a century.

                    <p>
                        it's been a blessing to be your little brother all these
                        years and i'm grateful for all the memories that we have
                        made with each other, and the journeys that we have been
                        through together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        your continuous faith and trust in God is very much an
                        example to me.

                        praying much for your future and that the Lord will lead
                        you, guide you, and be your guide for the next years of
                        your life just as He has been faithful to you all these
                        years.
