           Among the dozens of Nike-branded items the site offers are the U.S. sportswear maker’s Phantom GT2 Elite soccer boots, for 29,999 roubles, or around $330.
The man who got these shoes to Russia is Wijnand Herinckx, a 40-year-old Dutch citizen who lives in Moscow. Since the conflict began, Herinckx has built a thriving business that provides Russian consumers with Western goods whose makers have pulled out of Russia.
“Nike does not want their products to be shipped to Russia,” Herinckx told Reuters in a video call from his office on the outskirts of Moscow, where shelves are stacked with boxes of Western branded footwear. But he added: “They are also not telling us not to do it.”
Both Nike(NKE.N), opens new tab and Lego told Reuters they have not authorized Herinckx’s imports of their goods to Russia.<br></br><br></br>
By examining customs data, corporate records and internal company documents, and by speaking to Herinckx himself, Reuters learned how his business obtains branded goods including Nike and Lego: It uses intermediaries with no apparent connection to Russia as buyers, then ships the goods to Russia – often via Turkey – and finally delivers them to retailers in Russia.
There are at least dozens of firms like Herinckx’s employing grey-market methods to get Western goods to Russia, according to a Reuters analysis of customs data. His operation shows how attempts by Western governments and brands to isolate Russia’s economy are crashing into a reality of global business: Where there’s demand, someone will meet it.
Western governments’ restrictions have mostly focused on industrial products that can be used to build weapons for Russia’s war machine. Such products are usually subject to U.S. and European Union sanctions. Herinckx said his focus is on consumer goods not covered by sanctions. Reuters found no evidence that his firm was violating sanctions.
